    <p> Im here to  tell you about the greatest show of all time. The Wire. Now you may be asking, how can you say that when shows like The Sopranos and Breaking Bad exist? Those are great shows, some of the greatest. However what makes the wire a better show is that fact that it compounds upon itsself showing both a personal story for the criminals and poilice, as well as showing the very much similaraties between the cops and the very criminals they chase.  </p>

    <p>In Season 1 of the Wire, We have quite a bit of world building for both the Baltimore Police Department (who will be referred to the BPD) and the Baltimore drug trade. However we dont get gangs persay, but individual members of both sides.On the BPD, we have dysfunctional alcholic detective Jim McNulty who is willing to bend the rules to catch criminals, such as lying on beeper logs to catch the leader of the drug trade on the west side of Baltimore.  </p>
