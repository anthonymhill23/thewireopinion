    <p> Im here to  tell you about the greatest show of all time. The wire. Now you may be asking, how can you say that when shows like the sopranos and breaking bad exist? Those are great shows, some of the greatest. However what makes the wire a better show is that fact that it compounds upon itsself showing both a personal story for the criminals and poilice, as well as showing the very much similaraties between the cops and the very criminals they chase.  </p>
